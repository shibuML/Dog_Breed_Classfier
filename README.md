# Dog_Breed_Classfier
In this project, I have build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, my algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.  Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, I will make important design decisions about the user experience for my app. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer. My the imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!
